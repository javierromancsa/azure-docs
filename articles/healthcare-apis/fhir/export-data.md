# How to export FHIR data

The bulk `$export` operation in the FHIR service allows users to export data as described in the [HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html). 

Before attempting to use `$export`, make sure that your FHIR service is configured to connect with an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) account. For configuring export settings and creating an ADLS Gen2 account, refer to the [Configure settings for export](./configure-export-data.md) page.

## Calling the `$export` endpoint

After setting up the FHIR service to connect with an ADLS Gen2 account, you can call the `$export` endpoint and the FHIR service will export data into a blob storage container inside the storage account. The example request below exports all resources into a container specified by name (`{{containerName}}`). Note that the container in the ADLS Gen2 account must be created beforehand if you want to specify the `{{containerName}}` in the request.

```
GET {{fhirurl}}/$export?_container={{containerName}}
```

If you don't specify a container name in the request (e.g., by calling `GET {{fhirurl}}/$export`), then a new container with an auto-generated name will be created for the exported data.

For general information about the FHIR `$export` API spec, please see the [HL7 FHIR Export Request Flow](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#request-flow) documentation.


**Jobs stuck in a bad state**

In some situations, there's a potential for a job to be stuck in a bad state while the FHIR service is attempting to export data. This can occur especially if the ADLS Gen2 account permissions haven't been set up correctly. One way to check the status of your `$export` operation is to go to your storage account's **Storage browser** and see if any `.ndjson` files are present in the export container. If the files aren't present and there are no other `$export` jobs running, then there's a possibility the current job is stuck in a bad state. In this case, you can cancel the `$export` job by calling the FHIR service API with a `DELETE` request. Later you can requeue the `$export` job and try again. Information about canceling an `$export` operation can be found in the [Bulk Data Delete Request](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#bulk-data-delete-request) documentation from HL7. 

> [!NOTE] 
> In the FHIR service, the default time for an `$export` operation to idle in a bad state is 10 minutes before the service will stop the operation and move to a new job. 

The FHIR service supports `$export` at the following levels:
* [System](https://hl7.org/Fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#endpoint---system-level-export): `GET {{fhirurl}}/$export`
* [Patient](https://hl7.org/Fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#endpoint---all-patients): `GET {{fhirurl}}/Patient/$export`
* [Group of patients*](https://hl7.org/Fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#endpoint---group-of-patients) â€“ *The FHIR service exports all referenced resources but doesn't export the characteristics of the group resource itself: `GET {{fhirurl}}/Group/[ID]/$export`

When data is exported, a separate file is created for each resource type. The FHIR service will create a new file when the size of a single exported file exceeds 64 MB. The result is that you may get multiple files for a resource type, which will be enumerated (e.g., `Patient-1.ndjson`, `Patient-2.ndjson`). 

> [!Note] 
> `Patient/$export` and `Group/[ID]/$export` may export duplicate resources if a resource is in multiple groups or in a compartment of more than one resource.

In addition to checking the presence of exported files in your storage account, you can also check your `$export` operation status through the URL in the `Content-Location` header returned in the FHIR service response. See the HL7 [Bulk Data Status Request](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#bulk-data-status-request) documentation for more information.

### Exporting FHIR data to ADLS Gen2

Currently the FHIR service supports `$export` to ADLS Gen2 accounts, with the following limitations:

- ADLS Gen2 provides [hierarchical namespaces](../../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace.md), yet there isn't a way to target `$export` operations to a specific subdirectory within a container. The FHIR service is only able to specify the destination container for the export (where a new folder for each `$export` operation is created).
- Once an `$export` operation is complete and all data has been written inside a folder, the FHIR service doesn't export anything to that folder again since subsequent exports to the same container will be inside a newly created folder.

To export data to a storage account behind a firewall, see [Configure settings for export](configure-export-data.md).

## Settings and parameters

### Headers
There are two required header parameters that must be set for `$export` jobs. The values are set according to the current HL7 [$export specification](https://hl7.org/Fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#headers).
* **Accept** - `application/fhir+json`
* **Prefer** - `respond-async`

### Query parameters
The FHIR service supports the following query parameters for filtering exported data. All of these parameters are optional.

|Query parameter        | Defined by the FHIR Spec?    |  Description|
|------------------------|---|------------|
| `_outputFormat` | Yes | Currently supports three values to align to the FHIR Spec: `application/fhir+ndjson`, `application/ndjson`, or just `ndjson`. All export jobs will return `.ndjson` files and the passed value has no effect on code behavior. |
| `_since` | Yes | Allows you to only export resources that have been modified since the time provided. |
| `_type` | Yes | Allows you to specify which types of resources will be included. For example, `_type=Patient` would return only patient resources.|
| `_typeFilter` | Yes | To request finer-grained filtering, you can use `_typeFilter` along with the `_type` parameter. The value of the `_typeFilter` parameter is a comma-separated list of FHIR queries that further limit the results. |
| `_container` | No |  Specifies the name of the container in the configured storage account where the data should be exported. If a container is specified, the data will be exported into a folder in that container. If the container isn't specified, the data will be exported to a new container with an auto-generated name. |

> [!Note]
> Only storage accounts in the same subscription as the FHIR service are allowed to be registered as the destination for `$export` operations.
