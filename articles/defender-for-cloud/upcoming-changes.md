### Change in pricing of runtime protection for Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

**Estimated date for change:** August 2022

Runtime protection is currently a preview feature for Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. In August, Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters will be charged for runtime protection. You can view pricing details on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/). Subscriptions with Kubernetes clusters already onboarded to Arc will begin to incur charges in August.

### Multiple changes to identity recommendations

**Estimated date for change:** September 2022

Defender for Cloud includes multiple recommendations for improving the management of users and accounts. In June, we'll be making the changes outlined below.

#### New recommendations in preview

The new release will bring the following capabilities:

- **Extended evaluation scope** – Improved coverage to identity accounts without MFA and external accounts on Azure resources (instead of subscriptions only) allowing security admins to view role assignments per account.

- **Improved freshness interval** - Currently, the identity recommendations have a freshness interval of 24 hours. This update will reduce that interval to 12 hours.

- **Account exemption capability** - Defender for Cloud has many features you can use to customize your experience and ensure that your secure score reflects your organization's security priorities. For example, you can [exempt resources and recommendations from your secure score](exempt-resource.md).

    This update will allow you to exempt specific accounts from evaluation with the six recommendations listed in the following table.

    Typically, you'd exempt emergency “break glass” accounts from MFA recommendations, because such accounts are often deliberately excluded from an organization's MFA requirements. Alternatively, you might have external accounts that you'd like to permit access to but which don't have MFA enabled.

    > [!TIP]
    > When you exempt an account, it won't be shown as unhealthy and also won't cause a subscription to appear  unhealthy.

    |--|--|
    |Accounts with owner permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled|6240402e-f77c-46fa-9060-a7ce53997754|
    |Accounts with write permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled|c0cb17b2-0607-48a7-b0e0-903ed22de39b|
    |Accounts with read permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled|dabc9bc4-b8a8-45bd-9a5a-43000df8aa1c|

    |Blocked accounts with read and write permissions on Azure resources should be removed| 1ff0b4c9-ed56-4de6-be9c-d7ab39645926 |

### Removing security alerts for machines reporting to cross-tenant Log Analytics workspaces 

**Estimated date for change:** September 2022

Defender for Cloud lets you choose the workspace that your Log Analytics agents report to. When a machine belongs to one tenant (“Tenant A”) but its Log Analytics agent reports to a workspace in a different tenant (“Tenant B”), security alerts about the machine are reported to the first tenant (“Tenant A”).

With this change, alerts on machines connected to Log Analytics workspace in a different tenant will no longer appear in Defender for Cloud.

If you want to continue receiving the alerts in Defender for Cloud, connect the Log Analytics agent of the relevant machines to the workspace in the same tenant as the machine.

### Legacy Assessments APIs deprecation

The following APIs are set to be deprecated:

- Security Tasks
- Security Statuses
- Security Summaries

These three APIs exposed old formats of assessments and will be replaced by the [Assessments APIs](/rest/api/securitycenter/assessments) and [SubAssessments APIs](/rest/api/securitycenter/sub-assessments). All data that is exposed by these legacy APIs will also be available in the new APIs.
