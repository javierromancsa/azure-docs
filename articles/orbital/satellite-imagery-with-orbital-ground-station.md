# Tutorial: Collect and process Aqua satellite data using Azure Orbital Ground Station (AOGS)

This article is a comprehensive walk-through showing how to use the [Azure Orbital Ground Station (AOGS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/orbital/) to capture and process satellite imagery. It introduces the AOGS and its core concepts and shows how to schedule contacts. The article also steps through an example in which we collect and process NASA Aqua satellite data in an Azure virtual machine (VM) using NASA-provided tools.

Aqua is a polar-orbiting spacecraft launched by NASA in 2002. Data from all science instruments aboard Aqua is downlinked to the Earth using direct broadcast over the X-band in near real-time. More information about Aqua can be found on the [Aqua Project Science](https://aqua.nasa.gov/) website. 

Using AOGS, we capture the Aqua broadcast when the satellite is within line of sight of a ground station by scheduling a *contact*. A *contact* is time reserved at a ground station to communicate with a satellite. During the contact, the ground station orients its antenna towards Aqua and captures the direct broadcast data. The captured data is sent to an Azure VM as a data stream and processed using the [Real-Time Software Telemetry Processing System](http://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.cfm?section=technology&page=NISGS&subpage=NISFES&sub2page=RT-STPS&sub3Page=overview)(RT-STPS) tool provided by the [Direct Readout Laboratory](http://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/)(DRL) which generates a Level-0 product. This Level-0 product is processed further using DRL's [International Planetary Observation Processing Package](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/?id=dspContent&cid=68)(IPOPP) tool to produce higher level products.

In this tutorial, we will follow these steps to collect and process Aqua data:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Schedule a contact and collect Aqua direct broadcast data using AOGS](#step-1-schedule-a-contact-and-collect-aqua-direct-broadcast-data-using-aogs).
> * [Process Aqua direct broadcast data using RT-STPS](#step-2-process-aqua-direct-broadcast-data-using-rt-stps).
> * [Create higher level products using IPOPP](#step-3-create-higher-level-products-using-ipopp).

Optional setup steps for capturing the ground station telemetry are included in the [Appendix](#appendix).

## Step 1: Schedule a contact and collect Aqua direct broadcast data using AOGS

Follow the steps listed in [Tutorial: Downlink data from NASA's AQUA public satellite](downlink-aqua.md) to schedule a contact with Aqua using AOGS and collect the direct broadcast data on an Azure VM for further processing. 

> [!NOTE]
> In the section [Prepare a virtual machine (VM) to receive the downlinked AQUA data](downlink-aqua.md#prepare-your-virtual-machine-vm-and-network-to-receive-aqua-data), use the following values:
>
>   - **Name:** receiver-vm
>   - **Operating System:** Linux (CentOS Linux 7 or higher)
>   - **Size:** Standard_D8s_v5 or higher
>   - **IP Address:** Ensure that the VM has at least one standard public IP address

At the end of this step, you should have the raw direct broadcast saved as ```.bin``` files under the ```~/aquadata``` folder on the receiver-vm. 

## Step 2: Process Aqua direct broadcast data using RT-STPS

The [Real-time Software Telemetry Processing System](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/?id=dspContent&cid=69)(RT-STPS) is a NASA-provided software for processing Aqua direct broadcast data. The steps below cover installation of RT-STPS Verson 6.0 on the receiver-vm, and production of Level-0 Production Data Set(PDS) files from the data collected in the previous step. 

Register with the [NASA DRL](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) to download the RT-STPS installation package.

Transfer the installation binaries to the receiver-vm:

```console
ssh azureuser@receiver-vm 'mkdir -p ~/software'
scp RT-STPS_6.0*.tar.gz azureuser@receiver-vm:~/software/.
```

Alternatively, you can upload your installation binaries to a container in Azure Storage and download them to the receiver-vm using [AzCopy](../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md)

### Install rt-stps

```console
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk
cd ~/software
tar -xzvf RT-STPS_6.0.tar.gz
cd ./rt-stps
./install.sh
```

### Install rt-stps patches

```console
cd ~/software
tar -xzvf RT-STPS_6.0_PATCH_1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf RT-STPS_6.0_PATCH_2.tar.gz
tar -xzvf RT-STPS_6.0_PATCH_3.tar.gz
cd ./rt-stps
./install.sh
```

### Validate install

```console
cd ~/software
tar -xzvf RT-STPS_6.0_testdata.tar.gz
cd ~/software/rt-stps
rm ./data/*
./bin/batch.sh config/npp.xml ./testdata/input/rt-stps_npp_testdata.dat
# Verify that files exist
ls -la ./data
```

### Create Level-0 product

Run rt-stps in batch mode to process the ```.bin``` file collected in Step 1

```console
cd ~/software/rt-stps
./bin/batch.sh ./config/aqua.xml ~/aquadata/raw-2022-05-29T0957-0700.bin
```

This command produces Level-0 Production Data Set (```.pds```) files under the ```~/software/rt-stps/data``` directory.

## Step 3: Create higher level products using IPOPP

[International Planetary Observation Processing Package (IPOPP)](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/?id=dspContent&cid=68) is another NASA-provided software to process Aqua Level-0 data into higher level products.
In the steps below, you'll process the Level-0 data generated in the previous step using IPOPP.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to potential resource contention, DRL recommends installing RT-STPS and IPOPP on separate machines. But for this tutorial, we install both on the our receiver-vm because we don't run them at the same time. For production workloads, please follow sizing and isolation recommendations in the user guides available on the DRL website. 

### Attach a data disk to the receiver-vm

IPOPP installation and subsequent generation of products requires more disk space and I/O throughput than what is available on the receiver-vm by default. 
To provide more disk space and throughput, attach a 1TB premium data disk to the receiver-vm by following steps in [Attach a data disk to a Linux VM](../virtual-machines/linux/attach-disk-portal.md)

### Create a file system on the data disk

```console
lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -i "sd"
sudo parted /dev/sdb --script mklabel gpt mkpart xfspart xfs 0% 100% 
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
sudo partprobe /dev/sdb1 
sudo mkdir /datadrive
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /datadrive
sudo chown azureuser:azureuser /datadrive
```
> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that the datadrive is mounted automatically after every reboot, please refer to [Attach a data disk to a Linux VM](../virtual-machines/linux/attach-disk-portal.md#mount-the-disk) for instructions on how to add an entry to ```/etc/fstab```


### Install Desktop and VNC Server

IPOPP installation requires using a browser to sign on to the DRL website to download the installation script. This script must be run from the same host that it was downloaded to. The subsequent IPOPP configuration also requires a GUI. Therefore, we install a full desktop and a vnc server to enable running GUI applications on the receiver-vm.

```console
sudo yum install tigervnc-server
sudo yum groups install "GNOME Desktop"
```

Start VNC server:

```console
vncsever
```
Enter a password when prompted. 

Port forward the vncserver port (5901) over ssh:

```console
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 azureuser@receiver-vm
```

Download the [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) viewer and connect to ```localhost:5901``` and enter the vncserver password entered in the previous step.  You should see the GNOME desktop running on the VM. 

Start a new terminal, and start the Firefox browser

```console
firefox
```

[Log on the DRL website](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/loginDRL.cfm?cid=320&type=software) and download the downloader script.

Run the downloader script from the ```/datadrive/ipopp``` directory because
the home directory isn't large enough to hold the downloaded content.

```console
INSTALL_DIR=/datadrive/ipopp
cp ~/Downloads/downloader_DRL-IPOPP_4.1.sh $INSTALL_DIR
cd $INSTALL_DIR
./downloader_DRL-IPOPP_4.1.sh
```

This script will download \~35G and will take 1 hour or more.

Alternatively, you can upload your installation binaries to a container in Azure Storage and download them to the receiver-vm using [AzCopy](../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md)

### Install IPOPP

```console
tar --C $INSTALL_DIR -xzf DRL-IPOPP_4.1.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 $INSTALL_DIR/IPOPP
$INSTALL_DIR/IPOPP/install_ipopp.sh -installdir $INSTALL_DIR/drl -datadir $INSTALL_DIR/data -ingestdir $INSTALL_DIR/data/ingest
```

### Install IPOPP patches

```console
$INSTALL_DIR/drl/tools/install_patch.sh $PATCH_FILE_NAME
```
### Start IPOPP services

```console
$INSTALL_DIR/drl/tools/services.sh start
```
### Verify service status

```
$INSTALL_DIR/drl/tools/services.sh status
$INSTALL_DIR/drl/tools/spa_services.sh status
```

### Configure IPOPP services using its dashboard

Before we can create Level-1 and Level-2 products from the Level-0 PDS files generated by rt-stps, we need to configure IPOPP. IPOPP must be configured with its dashboard GUI. To start the dashboard, first port forward the vncserver port (5901) over ssh:

```console
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 azureuser@receiver-vm
```

Using the TightVNC client, connect to localhost:5901 and enter the vncserver password. On the virtual machine desktop, open a new terminal and start the dashboard:

```console
cd /datadrive/ipopp
./drl/tools/dashboard.sh &Â 
```

1. IPOPP Dashboard starts in process monitoring mode. Switch to **Configuration Mode** by using the menu option.Â 

2. Aqua related products can be configured from EOS tab in configuration mode. Disable all other tabs. We're interested in the MODIS Aerosol L2 (MOD04) product, which is produced by IMAPP SPA. Therefore, enable the following in the **EOS** tab:Â 

    - gbadÂ 

    - MODISL1DB l0l1aquaÂ 

    - MODISL1DB l1atobÂ 

    - IMAPPÂ 

3. After updating the configuration, switch back to **Process Monitoring** mode using the menu. All tiles will be in OFF mode initially.Â 

4. When prompted, save changes to the configuration.Â Â 

5. Click **Start Services** in the action menu. Note that **Start Services** is only enabled in process monitoring mode.Â Â 

6. Click **Check IPOPP Services** in action menu to validate.

## Ingest data for processing

Copy the Level-0 PDS files generated by RT-STPS to the IPOPP ingest directory for further processing.

```console
cp ~/software/rt-stps/data/* /datadrive/ipopp/drl/data/dsm/ingest/.
```

Run IPOPP ingest to create the products configured in the dashboard.Â 

```
/datadrive/ipopp/drl/tools/ingest_ipopp.sh
```

You can watch the progress in the dashboard.

```
/datadrive/ipopp/drl/tools/dashboard.sh
```

IPOPP will produce output products in the following directories:

```
/datadrive/ipopp/drl/data/pub/gsfcdata/aqua/modis/level[0,1,2]Â 
```
