# Azure DNS Private Resolver endpoints and rulesets

In this article, you'll learn about components of the [Azure DNS Private Resolver](dns-private-resolver-overview.md). Inbound endpoints, outbound endpoints, and DNS forwarding rulesets are discussed. Properties and settings of these components are described, and examples are provided for how to use them.

> Azure DNS Private Resolver is currently in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

## Inbound endpoints

As the name suggests, inbound endpoints will ingress to Azure. Inbound endpoints provide an IP address to forward DNS queries from on-premises and other locations outside your virtual network. DNS queries sent to the inbound endpoint are resolved using Azure DNS. Private DNS zones that are linked to the virtual network where the inbound endpoint is provisioned are resolved by the inbound endpoint. 

The IP address associated with an inbound endpoint is always part of the private virtual network address space where the private resolver is deployed.  No other resources can exist in the same subnet with the inbound endpoint. The following screenshot shows an inbound endpoint with an IP address of 10.10.0.4 inside the subnet `snet-E-inbound` provisioned within a virtual network with address space of 10.10.0.0/16.

## Outbound endpoints

Outbound endpoints egress from Azure and can be linked to [DNS Forwarding Rulesets](#dns-forwarding-rulesets).

Outbound endpoints are also part of the private virtual network address space where the private resolver is deployed. An outbound endpoint is associated with a subnet, but isn't provisioned with an IP address like the inbound endpoint.  No other resources can exist in the same subnet with the outbound endpoint. The following screenshot shows an outbound endpoint inside the subnet `snet-E-outbound`.

## DNS forwarding rulesets

DNS forwarding rulesets enable you to specify one or more custom DNS servers to answer queries for specific DNS namespaces. The individual [rules](#rules) in a ruleset determine how these DNS names are resolved. Rulesets can also be linked one or more virtual networks, enabling resources in the vnets to use the forwarding rules that you configure.

Rulesets have the following associations: 
- A single ruleset can be associated with multiple outbound endpoints. 
- A ruleset can have up to 1000 DNS forwarding rules. 
- A ruleset can be linked to any number of virtual networks in the same region

A ruleset can't be linked to a virtual network in another region. 

When you link a ruleset to a virtual network, resources within that virtual network will use the DNS forwarding rules enabled in the ruleset. The linked virtual network must peer with the virtual network where the outbound endpoint exists. This configuration is typically used in a hub and spoke design, with spoke vnets peered to a hub vnet that has one or more private resolver endpoints. In this hub and spoke scenario, the spoke vnet does not need to be linked to the private DNS zone in order to resolve resource records in the zone. In this case, the forwarding ruleset rule for the private zone sends queries to the hub vnet's inbound endpoint. For example: **azure.contoso.com** to **10.10.0.4**.

The following screenshot shows a DNS forwarding ruleset linked to two virtual networks: a hub vnet: **myeastvnet**, and a spoke vnet: **myeastspoke**.

Virtual network links for DNS forwarding rulesets enable resources in vnets to use forwarding rules when resolving DNS names. Vnets that are linked from a ruleset, but don't have their own private resolver, must have a peering connection to the vnet that contains the private resolver. The vnet with the private resolver must also be linked from any private DNS zones for which there are ruleset rules.

For example, resources in the vnet `myeastspoke` can resolve records in the private DNS zone `azure.contoso.com` if:
- The vnet `myeastspoke` peers with `myeastvnet` 
- The ruleset provisioned in `myeastvnet` is linked to `myeastspoke` and `myeastvnet`
- A ruleset rule is configured and enabled in the linked ruleset to resolve `azure.contoso.com` using the inbound endpoint in `myeastvnet`

### Rules

DNS forwarding rules (ruleset rules) have the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Rule name | The name of your rule. The name must begin with a letter, and can contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. |
| Domain name | The dot-terminated DNS namespace where your rule applies. The namespace must have either zero labels (for wildcard) or between 2 and 34 labels. For example, `contoso.com.` has two labels. |
| Destination IP:Port | The forwarding destination. One or more IP addresses and ports of DNS servers that will be used to resolve DNS queries in the specified namespace. |
| Rule state | The rule state: Enabled or disabled. If a rule is disabled, it's ignored. |

If multiple rules are matched, the longest prefix match is used.  

For example, if you have the following rules:

| Rule name | Domain name | Destination IP:Port | Rule state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contoso | contoso.com. | 10.100.0.2:53 | Enabled  |
| AzurePrivate | azure.contoso.com. | 10.10.0.4:53 | Enabled  |
| Wildcard | . | 10.100.0.2:53 | Enabled  |

A query for `secure.store.azure.contoso.com` will match the **AzurePrivate** rule for `azure.contoso.com` and also the **Contoso** rule for `contoso.com`, but the **AzurePrivate** rule takes precedence because the prefix `azure.contoso` is longer than `contoso`.
