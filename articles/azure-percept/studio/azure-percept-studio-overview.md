# Azure Percept Studio overview

Azure Percept Studio is a user-friendly portal for creating, deploying, and operating Edge artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Using a low-code to no-code approach, you can discover and complete guided workflows and create an end-to-end Edge AI solution. This solution integrates Azure IoT and Azure AI cloud services like Azure IoT Hub, IoT Edge, Azure Storage, Log Analytics, and Spatial Analysis from Azure Cognitive Services.

With Azure Percept Studio, you can connect your Edge AI compute devices and cameras and then configure and apply the pre-built AI skills included with Azure Precept Studio to automate and transform your operations at the edge. For example, you can use your cameras to count people in an area, detect when people cross a line, or when people enter/exit a restricted or secured area. You can then use AI skills to help you analyze this data in real-time so you can manage queues, space utilization, and occupancy, like a store entrance or exit, a curbside pickup area, or intruders on secure premises.

## Azure Percept Studio offers: 

- **No code, low code integrated flows**

  Whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer working on a pilot solution, Azure Percept Studio offers access to well-integrated workflows that you can use to reduce friction around building Edge AI solutions. You can create a pilot Edge AI solution in 10 minutes. 

- **People understanding AI skills**

  Azure Spatial Analysis is fully integrated in Azure Percept. Spatial Analysis detects the presence and movements of people in real time video feed from IP cameras. There are three skills available around people understanding: people counting in an area, detecting when people cross a line, and detecting when people enter/ exit and area. 

- **Gain insights and act**

  Once your solution is created, you can operate your devices and solutions remotely, monitor multiple video streams, and create live inference telemetry. To optimize your operations at the Edge, you can then aggregate inference data over time and derive insights and trends that you can use in real time to create alerts that help you be proactive instead of reactive.
