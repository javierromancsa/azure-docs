# Getting started with Azure Payment HSM

To get started with Azure Payment HSM (preview), contact your Microsoft sales representative and request access [via email](mailto:paymentHSMRequest@microsoft.com). Upon approval, you'll be provided with onboarding instructions.

## Availability

The Azure Public Preview is currently available in **East US** and **North Europe**.

## Prerequisites 

Azure Payment HSM customers must have:

- Access to the Thales Customer Portal (Customer ID)
- Thales smart cards and card reader for payShield Manager

## Cost

The HSM devices will be charged based on the service pricing page. All other Azure resources for networking and virtual machines will incur regular Azure costs too.

## payShield customization considerations

If you are using payShield on-premises today with a custom firmware, a porting exercise is required to update the firmware to a version compatible with the Azure deployment. Please contact your Thales account manager to request a quote.

Ensure that the following information is provided:
- Customization hardware platform (e.g., payShield 9000 or payShield 10K)
- Customization firmware number

## Support
