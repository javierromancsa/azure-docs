# Modify Azure AD Connect group writeback default behavior 

Group writeback is the feature that allows you to write cloud groups back to your on-premises Active Directory using Azure AD Connect Sync.  You can change the default behavior in the following ways: 

   - Only groups that are configured for write-back will be written back, including newly created Microsoft 365 groups. 
   - Groups that are written back will be deleted in AD when they're either disabled for group writeback, soft deleted, or hard deleted in Azure AD. 
   - Microsoft 365 groups with up to 250,000 members can be written back to on-premises. 

The following document will walk you through deploying the options for modifying the default behaviors of Azure AD Connect group writeback. 

## Considerations for existing deployments 

If the original version of group writeback is already enabled and in use in your environment, then all your Microsoft 365 groups have already been written back to AD. Instead of disabling all Microsoft 365 groups, you'll want to review any use of the previously written back groups, and disable only those that are no longer needed in on-premises AD. 

### Disable automatic writeback of all Microsoft 365 groups 

   1. To configure directory settings to disable automatic writeback of newly created Microsoft 365 groups, update the `NewUnifiedGroupWritebackDefault` setting to false. 
   2. To do this via PowerShell, use the: [New-AzureADDirectorySetting](../enterprise-users/groups-settings-cmdlets.md) cmdlet. 
   Example:  
     ```PowerShell 
     $TemplateId = (Get-AzureADDirectorySettingTemplate | where {$_.DisplayName -eq "Group.Unified" }).Id 
     $Template = Get-AzureADDirectorySettingTemplate | where -Property Id -Value $TemplateId -EQ 
     $Setting = $Template.CreateDirectorySetting() 
     $Setting["NewUnifiedGroupWritebackDefault"] = "False" 
     New-AzureADDirectorySetting -DirectorySetting $Setting 
     ``` 
   3. Via MS Graph: [directorySetting](/graph/api/resources/directorysetting?view=graph-rest-beta) 

### Disable writeback for each existing Microsoft 365 group. 

- Portal: [Entra admin portal](../enterprise-users/groups-write-back-portal.md) 
- PowerShell: [Microsoft Identity Tools PowerShell Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSIdentityTools/2.0.16) 
     Example: `Get-mggroup -filter "groupTypes/any(c:c eq 'Unified')" | Update-MsIdGroupWritebackConfiguration -WriteBackEnabled $false` 
- MS Graph: [Update group](/graph/api/group-update?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-beta) 

 

## Delete groups when disabled for writeback or soft deleted 

>[!Note]  
>After deletion in AD, written back groups are not automatically restored from the AD recycle bin, if they're re-enabled for writeback or restored from soft delete state. New groups will be created.  Deleted groups restored from the AD recycle bin, prior to being re-enabled for writeback or restored from soft delete state in Azure AD, will be joined to their respective Azure AD group. 

 1. On your Azure AD Connect server, open a PowerShell prompt as administrator. 
 2. Disable [Azure AD Connect sync scheduler](./how-to-connect-sync-feature-scheduler.md) 
 ``` PowerShell 
 Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false  
 ``` 
3. Create a custom synchronization rule in Azure AD Connect to delete written back groups when they're disabled for writeback or soft deleted  
 ```PowerShell 
 import-module ADSync 
 $precedenceValue = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a unique sync rule precedence value [0-99]" 

  New-ADSyncRule  ` 
  -Name 'In from AAD - Group SOAinAAD Delete WriteBackOutOfScope and SoftDelete' ` 
  -Identifier 'cb871f2d-0f01-4c32-a333-ff809145b947' ` 
  -Description 'Delete AD groups that fall out of scope of Group Writeback or get Soft Deleted in Azure AD' ` 
  -Direction 'Inbound' ` 
  -Precedence $precedenceValue ` 
  -PrecedenceAfter '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' ` 
  -PrecedenceBefore '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' ` 
  -SourceObjectType 'group' ` 
  -TargetObjectType 'group' ` 
  -Connector 'b891884f-051e-4a83-95af-2544101c9083' ` 
  -LinkType 'Join' ` 
  -SoftDeleteExpiryInterval 0 ` 
  -ImmutableTag '' ` 
  -OutVariable syncRule 

  Add-ADSyncAttributeFlowMapping  ` 
  -SynchronizationRule $syncRule[0] ` 
  -Destination 'reasonFiltered' ` 
  -FlowType 'Expression' ` 
  -ValueMergeType 'Update' ` 
  -Expression 'IIF((IsPresent([reasonFiltered]) = True) && (InStr([reasonFiltered], "WriteBackOutOfScope") > 0 || InStr([reasonFiltered], "SoftDelete") > 0), "DeleteThisGroupInAD", [reasonFiltered])' ` 
  -OutVariable syncRule 

 New-Object  ` 
 -TypeName 'Microsoft.IdentityManagement.PowerShell.ObjectModel.ScopeCondition' ` 
 -ArgumentList 'cloudMastered','true','EQUAL' ` 
 -OutVariable condition0 

 Add-ADSyncScopeConditionGroup  ` 
 -SynchronizationRule $syncRule[0] ` 
 -ScopeConditions @($condition0[0]) ` 
 -OutVariable syncRule 
 
 New-Object  ` 
 -TypeName 'Microsoft.IdentityManagement.PowerShell.ObjectModel.JoinCondition' ` 
 -ArgumentList 'cloudAnchor','cloudAnchor',$false ` 
 -OutVariable condition0 

 Add-ADSyncJoinConditionGroup  ` 
 -SynchronizationRule $syncRule[0] ` 
 -JoinConditions @($condition0[0]) ` 
 -OutVariable syncRule 

 Add-ADSyncRule  ` 
 -SynchronizationRule $syncRule[0] 

 Get-ADSyncRule  ` 
 -Identifier 'cb871f2d-0f01-4c32-a333-ff809145b947' 
 ``` 

4. [Enable group writeback](how-to-connect-group-writeback-enable.md) 
5. Enable Azure AD Connect sync scheduler 
 ``` PowerShell 
 Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true  
 ``` 

>[!Note] 
>Creating the synchronization rule will set the Full Synchronization flag to 'true' on the Azure Active Directory Connector, causing the rule changes to propagate through on the next synchronization cycle. 

## Writeback Microsoft 365 groups with up to 250,000 members 

Since the default sync rule, that limits the group size, is created when group writeback is enabled, the following steps must be completed after group writeback is enabled. 

1. On your Azure AD Connect server, open a PowerShell prompt as administrator. 
2. Disable [Azure AD Connect sync scheduler](./how-to-connect-sync-feature-scheduler.md) 
 ``` PowerShell 
 Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false  
 ``` 
3. Open the [synchronization rule editor](./how-to-connect-create-custom-sync-rule.md) 
4. Set the Direction to Outbound 
5. Locate and disable the ‘Out to AD – Group Writeback Member Limit’ synchronization rule 
6. Enable Azure AD Connect sync scheduler 
``` PowerShell 
 Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true  
``` 

>[!Note] 
>Disabling the synchronization rule will set the Full Synchronization flag to 'true' on the Active Directory Connector, causing the rule changes to propagate through on the next synchronization cycle. 

 

## Restoring from AD Recycle Bin 

If you're updating the default behavior to delete groups when disabled for writeback or soft deleted, we recommend that you enable the [Active Directory Recycle Bin](./how-to-connect-sync-recycle-bin.md) feature for your on-premises instances of Active Directory.  This feature will allow you to manually restore previously deleted AD groups, so that they can be rejoined to their respective Azure AD groups, if they were accidentally disabled for writeback or soft deleted. 

Prior to re-enabling for writeback, or restoring from soft delete in Azure AD, the group will first need to be restored in AD.
