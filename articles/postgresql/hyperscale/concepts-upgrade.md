# Hyperscale (Citus) server group upgrades

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-postgresql-hyperscale](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-hyperscale.md)]

The Hyperscale (Citus) managed service can handle upgrades of both the
PostgreSQL server, and the Citus extension. You can choose these versions
mostly independently of one another, except Citus 11 requires PostgreSQL 13 or
higher.

## Upgrade precautions

Upgrading a major version of Citus can introduce changes in behavior.
It's best to familiarize yourself with new product features and changes
to avoid surprises.

Noteworthy Citus 11 changes:

* Table shards may disappear in your SQL client. Their visibility
  is now controlled by
  [citus.show_shards_for_app_name_prefixes](reference-parameters.md#citusshow_shards_for_app_name_prefixes-text).
* There are several [deprecated
  features](https://www.citusdata.com/updates/v11-0/#deprecated-features).
